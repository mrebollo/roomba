# Instructor Solutions Status

There is a local directory named `solutions/` in this folder (`samples/solutions/`).

**It contains the full reference solutions for exercises 1 through 9.**

## Git Status
This directory is **IGNORED** by `.gitignore` to prevent accidental publication to the student repository.

## Important
- **DO NOT DELETE** the `solutions/` folder if you see it locally; it is your only copy of the answered exercises.
- If you clone this repository on a clean machine, you will **lose** these solutions unless you have a separate backup (they are not on the remote repo).
- To publish them: Edit `.gitignore` and remove/comment the exclusion rule for `samples/solutions/`.
