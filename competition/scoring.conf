# Roomba Competition Scoring Configuration
# =========================================
# This file defines how team scores are calculated from their statistics.
# Organizers can edit the weights and bonuses to customize the scoring system.
# Participants can use this file to understand how their scores are computed.

# Scoring Weights (must sum to 100)
# ---------------------------------
[weights]
coverage = 30              # Percentage of cells visited (exploration)
dirt_efficiency = 35       # Dirt cleaned per battery consumed
battery_conservation = 20  # Average battery remaining
movement_quality = 15      # Proportion of movements without crashes

# Note: Consistency is calculated automatically (not in weights sum)

# Note: Score formulas are hardcoded in score.c
# - Coverage: (cell_visited * 100) / cell_total
# - Dirt efficiency: (dirt_cleaned * 100) / bat_total
# - Battery conservation: mean(battery_remaining) / MAX-BATTERY * 100
# - Movement quality: 1 - (bumps / (forward + turn + bumps))
# - Consistency: 100 - std_deviation

# Bonus/Penalty Factors
# ---------------------
[bonuses]
# Bonus for completing all executions without crashes
completion_bonus = 5

# Bonus for low bump ratio (< 10% of movements)
low_bumps_bonus = 3

# Penalty for each crash detected
crash_penalty = 10

[thresholds]
# Maximum bump ratio to receive low_bumps_bonus (10%)
low_bumps_threshold = 0.10

# Minimum battery remaining to avoid warnings
min_battery_threshold = 200

# Display Options
# ---------------
[display]
# Show detailed breakdown per map in ranking
show_map_details = yes

# Number of top teams to highlight
highlight_top = 3

# Generate CSV file with all scores
generate_csv = yes

# Generate HTML report
generate_html = no
